# Introduction of Myself

Hello All,

First of all thanks for stopping by Intro of Myself !!!
My name is Santanu Mathur and I am working as Test Engineer for Telefonica O2 . Although I am tester but I'm interested in programming as well. I do scripting in Python from time to time but not very good at it. 
I hope to learn Python Programming and contribute to open source community :)
